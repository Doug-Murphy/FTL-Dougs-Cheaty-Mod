This mod is very cheaty! It will make things ridiculously easy for you. This mod does the following:
1. When starting a new game, it gives you the option to get 10,000 of all resources, delay the rebel fleet by 1,000 jumps, and scan the entire sector for you.
2. Set the starting level of all systems and subsystems for all ships to be the max level.
3. Change some ships to start with different weapons.
4. Change some ships to start with different and more crew.
5. Change Burst Laser III to cost 1 power and have a 1 second cooldown.
6. Give all ships 4 weapon slots and 4 drone slots.
