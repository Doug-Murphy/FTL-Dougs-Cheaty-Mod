# Introduction
Welcome to Doug's Cheaty FTL Mod. This mod is designed to be a total cheat-mode mod! It is guaranteed to make your playthrough a complete breeze.

It was designed for people who have already done as much as they wanted to in vanilla play and now want to just have some fun with the game.
Or maybe you just want to feel like a complete boss when you're playing a game, which is totally fine! Games are meant to be fun, so have fun with them.

# Functionality
What does this mod do? Well, many things! For a full list of what it does, I recommend reading the description from the [mod info file](/mod-appendix/metadata.xml).

# Installation
You can download the latest version of the mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/Doug-Murphy/FTL-Dougs-Cheaty-Mod/releases). After downloading the `.ftl` file, install it using Slipstream Mod Manager. This tool makes it extremely easy to install mods.
There are instructions for downloading, installing, and using the mod manager on [this forum post](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17102).
